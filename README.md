# NTI Network Security Project

This project is part of the **NTI Summer Internship - Network Security Track**.  
It demonstrates the design, configuration, and implementation of multiple security and networking technologies using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## üìå Project Scope
1. **Network Naming & IP Allocation**  
   - Assign names and IPs for all devices.  
   - Subnetting and LAN-to-LAN connectivity testing.  

2. **Dynamic Routing (OSPF)**  
   - OSPF configuration across routers.  
   - OSPF authentication for secure updates.  

3. **Network Services (Syslog, NTP, SSH)**  
   - Centralized Syslog logging.  
   - Time synchronization via NTP.  
   - Secure remote access using SSH.  

4. **AAA Security (RADIUS, TACACS+, Local)**  
   - Authentication and authorization with fallback.  

5. **Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)**  
   - Zones: Inside, Outside, DMZ.  
   - Security rules to control traffic.  

6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
   - Host-specific access (ICMP, SSH, HTTP).  
   - Mitigation of basic attacks.  

7. **Site-to-Site VPN (IPsec)**  
   - Secure encrypted tunnel between remote sites.  

8. **VLAN Segmentation & L2 Security**  
   - Management and Data VLANs.  
   - Inter-VLAN routing and L2 security features.
